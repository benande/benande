# Bio

I have been a professional data analyst working for large corporations for more than ten years. I kind of fell into this career by accident, but it turned out to be the perfect intersection of coding, mathematics, and design that really appeals to me. I am especially passionate about visualization, teaching, and communication. My most used tools are SQL, R, Tableau, and Excel.

# This Site

The inspiration for creating this site was reading about [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). It was pretty easy to set up and publish using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I have always wanted to carve out my own little corner of the internet, but I don't have much of a plan for it at this time.

I have a full-time job and a family, so I don't intend to update this site on a regular basis, only at the intersection of free time and inspiration.

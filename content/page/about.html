<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>I have been a professional data analyst working for large corporations for more than ten years. I kind of fell into this career by accident, but it turned out to be the perfect intersection of coding, mathematics, and design that really appeals to me. I am especially passionate about visualization, teaching, and communication. My most used tools are SQL, R, Tableau, and Excel.</p>

<h1>This Site</h1>
<p>The inspiration for creating this site was reading about <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a>. It was pretty easy to set up and publish using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I have always wanted to carve out my own little corner of the internet, but I donâ€™t have much of a plan for it at this time.</p>

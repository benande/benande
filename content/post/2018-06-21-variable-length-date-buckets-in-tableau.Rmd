```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

This is one of the Tableau techniques that I use in almost every dashboard I create. My users usually want to be able to look at trends daily, weekly, or monthly within the same view. This is pretty easy, but it takes a few steps.

# Dummy Data

First, let's use R to generate a year's worth of dummy data. If you don't use R, you could use Excel or Python. I'm using July through June to cross a year-end boundary.

```{r data}
data = as.data.frame(
  list(
    date = as.Date("2017-07-01") + seq(0,364),
    count = round(runif(365,0,1) * 100, digits = 0)),
  row.names = NULL)
write.csv(data, file = "dummy_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
head(data)
```

Next, open up Tableau, and import this CSV using "New Data Source" -> "More...", then navigate to your file.

# Parameter Setup
Next, create a new worksheet. Right-click anywhere in your "Data" area and select "Create Parameter":

Then, set it up as follows. You'll see some of the options change as you make your selections.

Right-click on your new Parameter, and select "Show Parameter Control". You will now have a Parameter drop-down on the right of the worksheet.

# Create Calculated Field
As with the Parameter, right click in your Data area, and select "Create Calculated Field...":

Set up your calculated field as follows. If you prefer for your weeks to start on a different day, such as 'Monday', enter that in place of 'Sunday'.

# Add to Worksheet
Drag "Time Period" to the Row shelf and Count to the Text mark. By default, Tableau changes Time Period to YEAR(Time Period). Right-click on this in the row area, then select "Exact Date". This changes Time Period to a continuous dimension, which we don't want. Right-click on Time Period again, and select "Discrete". Your worksheet should look like this:

Try out your parameter control. It should correctly adjust your date dimension. You could be done here, but there are a few ways to clean this up a bit.

# Polish
First, the date formatting is ugly. Right-click on Time Period in the Data area, select "Default Properties", then "Date Format". Select "Custom", and enter mm/dd as the date format.

Next, drag "Time Period" to the row shelf in front of the existing dimension, so that you get "YEAR(Time Period)" in addition to "Time Period". 

Finally, you'll want to add a filter so that you don't show partial periods. Right-click in the Data area to create another Calculated Field like this:

![](/post/2018-06-21-variable-length-date-buckets-in-tableau_files/tableau-variable-dates_current-period.png)

The value of this will be positive if the date is before the current period, and 0 if the date is in the current period. Right-click on "Current Period?" and convert it to a dimension. Drag it to the "Filters" area, then set it up like this:

Your final sheet should look something like this:

I find myself adding this parameter control to nearly every dashboard I create, and I hope you find it as useful as I do!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

This is one of the Tableau techniques that I use in almost every dashboard I create. My users usually want to be able to look at trends daily, weekly, or monthly within the same view. This is pretty easy, but it takes a few steps.

# Dummy Data

First, let's use R to generate a year's worth of dummy data. If you don't use R, you could use Excel or Python. I'm using July through June to cross a year-end boundary.

```{r data}
data = as.data.frame(
  list(
    date = as.Date("2017-07-01") + seq(0,364),
    count = round(runif(365,0,1) * 100, digits = 0)),
  row.names = NULL)
write.csv(data, file = "dummy_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
head(data)
```

Next, open up Tableau, and import this CSV using "New Data Source" -> "More...", then navigate to your file.

# Parameter Setup
To get started, create a new worksheet. Right-click anywhere in your "Data" area, and select "Create Parameter":

Set your parameter up as follows. You'll see some of the options change as you make your selections.

Right-click on your new Parameter, and select "Show Parameter Control". You will now have a Parameter dropdown on the right side of the worksheet.

# Calculated Field
As with the Parameter, right click in your Data area, and select "Create Calculated Field...":

Set up your calculated field as follows. If your weeks usually start on a different day, such as 'Monday', enter that in place of 'Sunday'.

# Add to Worksheet
Drag "Time Period" to the Row shelf and Count to Text in the Marks area. By default, Tableau changes Time Period to YEAR(Time Period). Right-click on this in the row area, then select "Exact Date". This changes Time Period to a continuous dimension, which we don't want. Right-click on Time Period again, and select "Discrete". Your worksheet should look like this:

Try out your parameter control. It should correctly adjust your date dimension between days, weeks, months, and quarters. You could be done here, but there are a few ways to clean this up a bit.

# Polish
First, the date formatting is ugly. Right-click on Time Period in the Data area, select "Default Properties", then "Date Format". Select "Custom", and enter mmm-dd as the date format. Formatting is tricky, since you'll be switching between months (where you don't care about the days) and days/weeks (where you do care about the days), but you can only use one format for the "Time Period" dimension. I have found that mmm-dd gives the best balance.

Next, drag "Time Period" to the row shelf in front of the existing dimension, so that you get "YEAR(Time Period)" in addition to "Time Period". 

Finally, add a filter so that the dashboard doesn't show partial periods. Right-click in the Data area to create another Calculated Field like this:

![](/post/2018-06-21-variable-length-date-buckets-in-tableau_files/tableau-variable-dates_current-period.png)

The value of this will be positive if the date is before the current period, and 0 if the date is in the current period. Right-click on "Current Period?" and convert it to a dimension. Drag it to the "Filters" area, then set it up like this:

I find myself adding this parameter control to nearly every dashboard I create, and I hope you find it as useful as I do!

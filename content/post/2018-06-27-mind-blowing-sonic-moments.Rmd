![](/post/2018-06-27-mind-blowing-sonic-moments/blown-away.jpg)

There's a lot to love about music: lyrics that make you cry, beats that make you dance, or guitar solos that remind you that you're a pathetic mortal. My favorite thing about music, though, is *sound*. These moments that come together to make you say, "I've never heard something like this before!" or maybe just "Whoa." You get goosebumps. The hair raises up on the back of your neck.

I'm not claiming these are the best or most important songs of all time. Many of those songs are sonically ordinary. In evaluating a song, it's important to keep in mind that every song doesn't have to have everything. For example, Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind" is *easily* one of of the best and most important songs ever written. The lyrics cut straight to your soul, and his deliver is honest and endearing. But, sonically, it's just a guy and a guitar. It was done hundreds of times before him, and countless times after.

This is also nowhere near a comprehensive list. How could it be? We've had more than a century of recorded music, and I've only heard a fraction of it. I'm also coming up with these songs off the top of my head, and I don't expect this to be the last post like this.

With all of those caveats out of the way, let me kick it off with the song that inspired this post.

# James Blake - Retrograde

The song opens with Sam Cooke-inspired hummed vocal line, which leads into a quiet opening with a sparse beat and a piano that's barely even there. There's a lot of space.

Then, at 1:37 into the song, it hits. Two opposing synth lines, one rising and the other falling (similar to the [retrograde motion of planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_and_prograde_motion), where the song gets its name). "Suddenly I'm hip!" A meandering top end and a heavy bass suddenly dominate the song, and it just keeps building for the next minute and half.

Then everything drops out, and you realize you haven't breathed since it began. Whatever remains fades away, until the song finally ends, and you're forced to listen again.

# Radiohead - Exit Music (For a Film)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/50rlHVe6g9Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Radiohead is a band that is so sonically creative, nearly any of their songs could be on this list, but I'm going to choose this one, because even thinking about it gives me chills.

Much like the song above, part of what makes this song so great is the slow build. It starts with just an acoustic guitar and voice, a lot of reverb, and a lot of space. The lyrics are creepy. You know something terrible is going to happen.

At 1:26, the Mellotron voices enter, and it just gets more ominous. At 2:35, the first tap of a cymbal is a harbinger for what's to follow. First, a simple drum fill, then massive, distorted bass. Contrasted by singing strings on top, this is suddenly a very different song. Thom Yorke's previously restrained voice builds and build until he's yelling.

Then, as suddenly as it began, it's over.

# Queen - Bring Back That Leroy Brown

And now for something completely different. 
You'd have to be a real asshole to argue against The Beatles as the #1 most creative and important band, but the argument for the #2 spot is a little more interesting, and I'll throw my weight behind Queen. They're another band that could easily have a dozen songs on this list, and Bohemian Rhapsody would be the most obvious choice, but I'm going to pick this gem.

Holy cocaine, they packed a lot of ideas into two and a half minutes. I think one of the most impressive things here is the precision, especially given the technology available at the time. There are so many harmonies and instrumental layers and razor-sharp turns that it's amazing the whole thing doesn't fall apart.

I think it's a concetrated example of everything I love about Queen: creativity, technical brilliance, musicianship, and humor.

# The Beatles - Tomorrow Never Knows

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHNbHn3i9S4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Speaking of The Beatles, "Tomorrow Never Knows" is probably my favorite song, period. Obviously, The Beatles had to appear here, and they also have dozens of songs with mind-blowing sonic moments. But this song is so unlike anything that came before it or after it, that I think it has to be the pinnacle. 

The cyclical drum beat, the tape loops, the rotating speaker vocals, the backward guitar solo - there's so much originality and brilliance here. And it was the *first* song they recorded for *Revolver*! [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGeF5RxlpaI) shows some of how this song was made. It makes you question what you think music is and what it can be. Without hyperbole, this song is pure genius.

# Chase - Get It On

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4SW2Z3_d8I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Okay, there's a lot about this song that's neither original nor great. Especially the lyrics. But, holy shit, the horns. Specifically, the cascading horns that start at 1:13. I'm willing to forgive a lot for that. It's the sort of thing you'd usually associate with a band like Chicago, with good reason. However, I'd like to highlight this lesser-known song instead.

# Vampire Weekend - Hannah Hunt

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uDwVMcEHG70?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Like other songs on this list, this song begins softly, with sweet lyrics and upright bass. The song builds a bit, but the cathartic moment comes at 2:40, when the snare drum (is that actually a snare drum?) hits, and the piano soars. In a rare moment for the band, singer Ezra Klein really lets loose, almost to the point of falling apart. Then, almost as soon as it began, the moment is over.

# Portishead - The Rip

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBOaLjtR4mw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Are you detecting a pattern yet? The best word I can think of to describe the first half of this song is "fragile". Singer Beth Gibbons' voice is so hypnotizing that the transition at 2:12 is jarring. It completely changes the song, with drums and synth suddenly dominating, taking over for the sparse guitars of the first half. The whole experience is haunting, and it's worth returning to, over and over.

# Alabama Shakes - Sound & Color

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/faG8RiaANek?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's just a vibraphone, right? What's the big deal? It's just so perfectly executed, and you don't hear them very often in pop music [since the days of Motown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS2nWLz-AbE). I think it's also notable since the song marks such a departure from the retro-soul of their first album. Every time I hear the beginning of this song, I have to stop what I'm doing. It's like a trance.
